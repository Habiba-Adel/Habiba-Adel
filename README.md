## 👋 About Me

I focus on **backend engineering** with the goal of building **robust, scalable, and maintainable systems**.

I care deeply about **strong fundamentals**, especially **operating systems, databases, and system design**, and I continuously dive deep into how things work under the hood. Problem solving is a core part of my learning process, and I actively work on improving it through consistent practice.

I strengthen my backend knowledge by studying high-quality resources such as **Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces (OSTEP)**, **High Performance MySQL**, and **Designing Data-Intensive Applications**, as well as academic courses like **CMU’s Introduction to Database Systems**.

I am also passionate about **contributing to open source projects**, where I enjoy collaborating with other developers, learning from real-world codebases, and applying engineering best practices in production environments.

I always try to **apply what I learn** by building practical side projects to turn theory into real-world engineering experience.
